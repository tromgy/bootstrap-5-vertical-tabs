// When the view is narrower than this navpill-like buttons are used,
// otherwise horizontal tabs are used up until $vertical-tabs-min width

// When the view is wider than this, vertical tabs are used
$vertical-tabs-min: 48em;

// Set this depending on the longest caption text of the tabs
// If the text is still longer than that, it will be truncated with ellipsis
// NOTE: there are practical limits on this value, the "good" values
// seem to be somewhere beetween 4 and 12rem;

// These only apply to regular (not sideways) vertical tabs
// In all other cases the text is center-aligned
